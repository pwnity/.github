Pwnity is dedicated to building professional-grade tools for penetration testers, red teams, and security researchers. Our mission is to tackle the operational chaos of security engagements by providing powerful, intuitive, and consistent workflow automation. We believe that by automating repetitive tasks and centralizing data, security professionals can focus on what truly matters: finding and mitigating vulnerabilities.

**[pwnity-cli](https://github.com/pwnity/pwnity-cli)** is a powerful, open-source command-line interface for orchestrating pentesting workflows. It replaces the mental overhead of manual commands and scattered notes with a structured system for managing targets, tools, and findings.

- Standardize your tool execution with reusable templates.
- Automate your command generation with a powerful placeholder engine.
- Centralize your findings with session-based reporting.

## The Vision: pwnity Pro

While the `pwnity-cli` will always be free and open-source, we are hard at work on **pwnity Pro** – a comprehensive web interface built on top of the powerful CLI core. The Pro version will feature a visual workflow editor, advanced dashboards, and team collaboration features. Stay tuned!
